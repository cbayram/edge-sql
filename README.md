edge-sql-plus
=============

This is an enhancement to the [edge-sql](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge-sql) project by Tomasz Janczuk.  In `edge-sql-plus` I have added the ability to execute stored procedures and pass TVP or Table-Valued Parameters. In addition, it allows for muliple result sets (not MARS but rather multiple record sets).

##### Original Readme 

This is a SQL compiler for edge.js. It allows accessing SQL databases from Node.js using Edge.js and ADO.NET. 

See [edge.js overview](http://tjanczuk.github.com/edge) and [edge.js on GitHub](https://github.com/tjanczuk/egde) for more information.
